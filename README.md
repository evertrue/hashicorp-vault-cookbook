[Application cookbook][0] for installing and configuring [Hashicorp Vault][1].

Vault is a tool, which when used properly, manages secure access to
secrets for your infrastructure.

## Basic Usage
This cookbook was designed from the ground up to make it dead simple
to install and configure a Vault cluster using Chef. It also highlights
several of our best practices for developing reusable infrastructure
at Bloomberg.

This cookbook provides [node attributes](attributes/default.rb) which
can be used to fine tune the default recipe which installs and
configures Kafka. The values from the node attributes are passed
directly into the configuration and service resources.

Most important of these attributes is `node['vault']['config']`, which is directly translated into JSON to be used as Vaultâ€™s configuration. See the [Vault config docs](https://vaultproject.io/docs/config/) for details on valid settings and values.

Out of the box the following platforms are certified to work and
are tested using our [Test Kitchen][8] configuration. Additional platforms
_may_ work, but your mileage may vary.
- CentOS (RHEL) 6.6, 7.1
- Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04

The correct way to use this cookbook is to create a
[wrapper cookbook][2] which configures all the members of the Vault
cluster. We provide an example [Vault Cluster cookbook][3] which
utilizes our [Consul cookbook][4] for a highly-available storage
solution for the cluster. Additionally, you can take a look at the [hashicorp-vault_tester cookbook](https://github.com/johnbellone/vault-cookbook/tree/master/test/cookbooks/hashicorp-vault_tester), as it is also a wrapper cookbook.

The wrapper cookbook is necessary, due to the lack of a default value for `node['vault']['config']['backend']`, which is required by Vault, and is not set due to the potential for attribute merging to create a config with two backends (which will prevent Vault from working).
